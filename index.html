<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I am a professional cook who enjoys grilling and smoking meats. I experiment with many different flavors and cultures and blend them with my own style of BBQ.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, I've adopted some of the best smoking practices from all over the world and combined them into one style.</p>
<p>See some of my favorite recipes below!</p>
