<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I am a professional cook who enjoys grilling and smoking meats. I experiment with many different flavors and cultures and blend them with my own style of BBQ. Over the past decade, I've adopted some of the best smoking practices from all over the world and combined them into one style.</p>
